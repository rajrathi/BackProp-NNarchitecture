# BackPropagation and Neural Network Architecture Basics

## Part 1

Following is the snapshot of excel sheet describing the process of BackPropagation in Neural Network:

### Following are the charts for Loss when we used different Learning Rate (LR):

LR = 0.1           |  LR = 0.2
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![LR = 0.1](LossGraphs/LR_1.png)  |  ![LR = 0.2](LossGraphs/LR_2.png)

LR = 0.5           |  LR = 0.8
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![LR = 0.1](LossGraphs/LR_5.png)  |  ![LR = 0.2](LossGraphs/LR_8.png)

LR = 1.0          |  LR = 2.0
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![LR = 0.1](LossGraphs/LR_10.png)  |  ![LR = 0.2](LossGraphs/LR_20.png)

## Part 2

I have achieved the accuracy of 99.35 with parameter count  equal to 19958. Following, I have explained the model architecture and more details:
